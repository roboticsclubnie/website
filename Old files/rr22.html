    <h2>About the event</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roborikishi is an annually held national-level event conducted by The Department of Mechanical Engineering and Robotics Club @ NIE. In this, students from different colleges participate and compete with each other in different events. This event mainly focuses on creating awareness about robotics and automation in students of all age groups irrespective of their discipline. As a part of the event, Robo-Expo would be organized where various Robotics-related projects build by us are exhibited. We have exciting competitions like the fastest line follower, maze solver, Robo war, Robo race. Students from all over the country build their bots to compete with each other. The goal is to test the creativity, programming, and designing skills of the contestants.</p>
