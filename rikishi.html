<p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
<p>Roborikishi is an annually held national-level event conducted by The Department of Mechanical Engineering and Robotics Club @ NIE. In this, students from different colleges participate and compete with each other in different events. This event mainly focuses on creating awareness about robotics and automation in students of all age groups irrespective of their discipline. As a part of the event, Robo-Expo would be organized where various Robotics-related projects build by us are exhibited. We have exciting competitions like the fastest line follower, maze solver, Robo war, Robo race. Students from all over the country build their bots to compete with each other. The goal is to test the creativity, programming, and designing skills of the contestants.</p>

        <p><span class="first-character sc">L</span>ine following is a type of robotics technology that enables a robot to navigate autonomously by following a line or track. It enhances interdisciplinary approach to mechanical, electronic, electrical, and programming skills.
          In a typical line following system, the robot is equipped with one or more sensors that detect the line or track on which it is moving. The most common type of sensor used is an infrared sensor, which detects the contrast between the line and the surrounding surface. Other types of sensors that may be used include photoelectric sensors, reflective sensors, or laser sensors.
          As the robot moves along the line, the sensor(s) detect the position of the line relative to the robot's current position. The robot's control system then uses this information to adjust the robot's speed and direction so that it stays on the line. The control system may use a variety of algorithms to determine the best course of action, such as PID (proportional-integral-derivative) control, fuzzy logic, or neural networks.
          Line following robots can be programmed to follow a wide variety of line configurations, including straight lines, curved lines, and lines with intersections, or branching paths. In addition, some line following systems can be designed to detect and avoid obstacles or to perform other tasks such as picking up and delivering items along the line.
          Line following technology is commonly used in applications such as factory automation, warehouse management, and transportation systems. One of the major advantages of line following technology is its ability to enable robots to operate autonomously in environments where human intervention would be difficult or dangerous.
          </p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10">Comprehensively, line following technology is a powerful tool for enabling robots to navigate autonomously in a wide variety of applications. With continued advances in robotics and sensor technology, it is likely that line following systems will become even more sophisticated and versatile along with greater advantage in the years to come.</p>

The evolution of UGG from a brand that made sheepskin boots, slippers, clogs and sandals for an active, outdoor lifestyle to a brand that was now being touted as a symbol of a stylish, casual and luxurious lifestyle was swift. Much of this was due to a brand repositioning effort that transformed UGG into a high-end luxury footwear maker. As a fashion brand, UGG advertisements now graced the pages of Vogue Magazine as well as other fashion books. In the mid 2000's, the desire for premium casual fashion was popping up all over the world and UGG was now perfectly aligned with this movement.</p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10">Fueled by celebrities from coast to coast wearing UGG boots and slippers on their downtime, an entirely new era of fashion was carved out. As a result, the desire and love for UGG increased as people wanted to go deeper into this relaxed UGG experience. UGG began offering numerous color and style variations on their sheepskin boots and slippers. Cold weather boots for women and men and leather casuals were added with great success. What started as a niche item, UGG sheepskin boots were now a must-have staple in everyone's wardrobe. More UGG collections followed, showcasing everything from knit boots to sneakers to wedges, all the while maintaining that luxurious feel UGG is known for all over the world. UGG products were now seen on runways and in fashion shoots from coast to coast. Before long, the love spread even further.</p>

        <p><span class="first-character atw">R</span>obowars is a form of competitive robotics where two or more robots fight against each other in an arena with the aim of destroying their opponents. This is a fascinating and challenging area of robotics that requires a combination of mechanical design, electrical engineering, and programming skills.

          The concept of robowars has been around for several decades, but the recent advancements in technology have allowed for more sophisticated and complex robots to be created, making the battles even more intense and exciting. The robots used in robowars are typically remote-controlled, with various weapons and defensive mechanisms added to increase their chances of victory.
          
          Participating in robowars is an  excellent opportunity for us to apply our skills and knowledge to a real-world application. Building a competitive robot involves a lot of planning, design, and testing, which can help club members develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills. Furthermore, participating in competitions can be a fantastic way to showcase the club's talent and skills while having fun and learning from other robotics enthusiasts.
